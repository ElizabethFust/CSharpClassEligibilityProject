# CSharpClassEligibilityProject
Project for Code Louisville C# Class May-July 2019:  Eligibility Determination

This project will provide a way for a user to determine if s/he is eligible for assistance from a charitable foundation.  S/he will enter his or her zip code and the program will search a csv file of poverty rates by zip code based on census data, and it will provide the poverty rate for the user's zip code.  If the poverty percentage of that area is 27.7% or higher, the person will be eligible for assistance.  

In the beginning, each user will be prompted to determine if s/he wants to (1) determine eligibility, (2) retrieve his or her data, or (3) exit.  

People seeking to determine eligibility: 

     1.  Prompted for first name, 
     2.  Prompted for last name, 
     3.  Prompted for zip code.  
     4.  Provided the poverty rate, based on the zip code, by the program.  
     5.  Asked if she wants to save her information
     6.  Assigned a unique ID, and the data will be saved.

People seeking to retrieve their information:

     1.  Prompted to enter their ID number
     2.  Their information is displayed to the screen
     3.  They are asked if they want to change their zip code.
     4.  If the zip code is changed, the program will calculate the new poverty rate
     5.  The user's information will be edited to include the new zip code and poverty rate.
