Project for Code Louisville C# Class May-Jully 2019:  Eligibility Determination

This project will provide a way for a user to determine if s/he is eligible for assistance from a charitable foundation.  S/he will enter his or her zip code and the program will search a csv file of poverty rates by zip code based on census data, and it will determine and provide the poverty rate for the user's zip code.  If the poverty percentage of that area is 29.7% or higher, the person will be eligible for assistance.  

In the beginning each user will be prompted to determine if s/he is a new user or a current user.  New users wiill be prompted for first name, last name, and zip code.  The user will be assigned an ID.  The user data will be saved. Any current user can retrieve his or her data.
